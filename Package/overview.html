			<h1>Developing Real Time Applications with WebRTC</h1>
			
			<h3 style="color: #FA8D11"> Leverage the power and simplicity of WebRTC to rapidly build a real time communication app </h3>
			
			
	<p>	This video course will equip you with the understanding to quickly develop a complete WebRTC application, ready to be integrated into your own web application. If you’re interested in creating a video application with WebRTC , this video delivers a strong example application which you can use, whilst laying the foundation for you to develop more complex instances in the future. 
  <br><br>
This courses opens with an introduction to WebRTC, placing it in context of similar technologies in the web environment, before diving into an exploration of key WebRTC APIs.
  <br><br>
After detailing the main API utilities, we’ll examine various signalling approaches before designing two servers, one for serving our example, and another one for providing signalling. At this point, we'll put all the pieces together to create a fully functional, real-time communication application.
<br><br>
The final section of this video course focuses on debugging and improving WebRTC applications treating other frameworks and developer tools which can be used to this end, with modern techniques employed by experienced developers. 
<br><br>
By the time you complete this video course, you will understand the fundamentals of WebRTC and its array of powerful APIs, with the ability to establish real-time video conferencing functionality over the web, with whoever you want.
